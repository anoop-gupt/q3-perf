Obesity has become an epidemic acorss the worls and same applies to web applications and web sites. An overweight web application/ site is directly linked to user drop outs, bad user experience and end up with poor sales conversions leading it to a disaster.

Good news is that you can lose weight in the browsers. "Lose weight now, ask me how!"

This quarter we will focus on "Speed and Performance" by reducing the page weight and other best practices to produce high performance websites and applications. 
We are also starting a monthly quiz based on our focus area. Based on your points earned in these quizes, your name and photo would be published in our Leaderboard and you may get a surprise as a reward.
